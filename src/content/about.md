# Hi, I'm Teddy

I’m an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Sociology at Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/). I'm interested in science and technology studies (STS), sociology of knowledge, sociology of medicine, and sociology of pain. I hope to focus my research on the relationship between scientific theories of pain and capital punishment in the USA.

In 2024, I earned my MSc in Science, Technology and Society at University College London. My master’s dissertation, _Does PredPol Dream of Objectivity? A Critical Discourse Analysis of Objectivity in Predictive Policing Promotional Materials_, used perspectives from science and technology studies to investigate a particular predictive policing technology company, PredPol. It can be found on the “Links” section of this page alongside a podcast where I discussed my research. While at UCL, I also helped produce the policy report Visions, values, voices: a survey of artificial intelligence researchers, which can also be found on the “Links” section.

Prior to UCL, I worked in the tech industry as a cloud solutions architect and earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at the University of Chicago.
